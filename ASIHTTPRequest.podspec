  s.summary      = "Easy to use CFNetwork wrapper for HTTP requests, Objective-C, Mac OS X and iPhone."

  s.description  = ASIHTTPRequest is an easy to use wrapper around the CFNetwork API that
                   makes some of the more tedious aspects of communicating with web servers
                   easier. It is written in Objective-C and works in both Mac OS X and iPhone
                   applications.
                   It is suitable performing basic HTTP requests and interacting with
                   REST-based services (GET / POST / PUT / DELETE). The included
                   ASIFormDataRequest subclass makes it easy to submit POST data and files
                   using multipart/form-data.

                   Please note that ASIHTTPRequest is not recommended for newer projects
                   since it's not actively maintained anymore.
